abstract: |
    **What is it that software sees, hears and perceives when technologies for pattern recognition are applied to media historical sources?**

    All historical work requires interpretation, but what kind of algorithmic interpretations of modernity does software yield from historical archives. MODERN-36 is empirically committed to everyday experiences and sets out to study how machines interpret symbols of modernity in media from 1936.

    By utilising photographic and audiovisual collections, MODERN-36 seeks to analyse how modern Sweden was, while also exploring how computational methods can help us understand modernity in new ways.
