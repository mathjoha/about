abstract: |
    A javascript based SPA (Single Page Application) for exploring and reading
    the timestamped Journal Digital Corpus right in the browser. This is
    hosted as a static website on GitHub and loads the publicly available
    corpus into the user's browser to make it readable and searchable. It can
    also produce stable URLs with seach queries and selected results. This way
    it is possible to create a permanent bookmark to a specific part of a
    specified version of the corpus.
