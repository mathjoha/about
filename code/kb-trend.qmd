abstract: |
    This is a tool for extracting trendlines for sesarches in the National
    Library of Sweden's (Kungliga Biblioteket; KB) search API. It comes in two
    variants, firtsly is the python implementation published on PyPI and
    therefore pip-installable. This tool is able to perform a battery of
    queries to create aggregated and disaggregated timelines. The second is a
    much simpler form, which is a SPA (Single Page Application) hosted as a
    static site on GitHub. This version performs a single query at a time and
    produces a downloadable .csv file of the data and relevant metadata --
    such as the full URL of the query.
