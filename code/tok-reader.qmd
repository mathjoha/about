abstract: |
    This is a JavaScript based tool for reading exchanges of utterances from
    the swedish parliamentary debates for the _Tal om Kvinnor_ project.
    The material is retrieved from the SWERIK project and has been
    [pre processed](https://github.com/DigitalHistory-Lund/ToK-Preparer/tree/2025-12-09)
    in preparation for this reader, namely:

      1. The corpus has been segmented into individual utterances.
      2. Speaker party and gender are in the utterance-level metadata.
      3. Utterances have been tagged with categories relevant for the research project.
      4. The corpus has been split into one file per year, from 1900-1940 (the period under study).

    The files are hosted next to the code that prepared them -- and each year's
    file is loaded into the reader as the user reaches that year. In this way
    the data becomes searchable, readable and browsable -- accessible --
    to people without having to wrangle with .xml files. However, searches are
    limited to a single year at a time.
