A few weeks ago I started playing around with Google's AI-Studio and Gemini.app
trying to test the limits of their public AI-systems can do. Among the
experiments were a series of disappoinging attempts to make it produce code and
a lot of amusement generating images and videos. I also gave it's 'research'
mode a spin which, unlike the code-generation and image-generation, requires
very little effort in the way of prompt-engineering to produce decent results.
You tell it to 'research' a topic (or topics), it presentes a plan of
investigation (which you can influence further) and 20-30 minutes later you
have your own wikipedia-like report (with less reliability). What impressed me
the most was how neatly it can be used on my phone, once it starts
'researching' I can close down the app and get a notification when the report
is ready (Not so for the other modes). This means that I can play around with
it before I walk somewhere and by the time I am there, I have something to new to read!

However, if I close down the app I do not get to see the number of 'researched'
sources tick upwards. Which is part of my fascination with the process; it
gives me a metric to target as I play around with it. Not only can you see how
many sources (sites) it searches, a selection of these sources are also
included as references in the report. To me, this is like having my own
personalized pesudo-Wikipedia-article generator. Only, less reliable, worse
prose, without images diagrams and links to other articles. But, it is a lot
more flexible and a lot more convenient. It can be used similarly to how I tend
to use Wikipedia: Get a basic understanding for some topic and gather further
resources to read further.

Besides the high dubiousness-level (technical term) of the fact checking, the
prose tends to be very boring and bland. It has a tendency to over-summarise
and sometimes over-explain simple information (based on my limited
experiments). So, I decided to attempt to make the prose more entertaining.
Specifically, to mimic the style of Douglas Hofstadter's fugues in _Gödel,
Escher, Bach_.

Hofstadter's fugues manage to be downright entertaining despite dealing with
abstract and complex ideas. So, I instructed Gemini to mimic this style while
explaining the ascent of AI. A secondary motive for picking this topic was to
produce a text or a case that I could use in teaching. At worst the output
would be nonsense and therefore an interesting case to discuss, OR it would
create a decent instructive overview. Either way, it had the potential to be
both entertaining and useful. Having picked the topic, picking the two main
discussants remained. Being lazy, I went with to of my default personas for an
LLM to impersonate: Edgar Allan Pie and William Shakespeare -- specifying that
more temporary characters can be introduced as needed.

The result was an 8,00 word report based on 167 'researches' websites out of which 124 were
cited in the report! Two personal records right there! In total the report
includes 7 fugues, and a prelude (included below). I must admit that I have to
date only read the preamble and the overviews (of which there are two in the
report!), but so far I am satisfied and entertained. Quite frankly, the most
disappointing part of the report is that it ends with the release of Chat-GPT;
sure it was an important event, but a lot of interesting things have happened
since then!

## Prelude: A Midnight Dreary, A Question Airy


`SCENE`:
```
A dimly lit study, overflowing with books and arcane instruments.
EDGAR ALLAN POE sits hunched over a desk, quill in hand,
the flickering candlelight casting long, dancing shadows.

The hour is late.
```

`POE`:
```
(Muttering to himself)
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
Not of demons, nor of ravens tapping at my chamber door,
But of intellect—that spectral architect of thought,
Its ghostly gears and levers, how a notion might be wrought
From the ether of the mind, a phantasm given form.
This engine in the skull, that conjures calm and storm,
Is it a sacred fire, a uniquely human spark?
Or can its essence be distilled, to animate the dark
And silent artifice of man, a mimicry of soul?
To cede to brass and wire, our intellectual control?
```

```
(WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE enters, a knowing glimmer in his eye.
He carries a folio, perhaps of his own works.)
```
`SHAKESPEARE`:

```
Good Master Poe, still wrestling with the shades of night?
Your brow is furrowed deep, as if by some internal fight.
What phantoms vex thee now? Is it the muse, that fickle sprite,
Or some new terror of the soul, that shuns the morning's light?
```

`POE`:
```
Ah, good Will. 'Tis not the muse, but a query yet more dire.
This "stuff that dreams are made on," as your Prospero did conspire
To name our fleeting thoughts – this power to reason and to feel,
Is it a gift divine, or something we might steal,
Or rather, replicate, in constructs of our own design?
Could mind itself be patterned, line by intricate line,
Like verse, or like the workings of some complex, ticking clock?
The ancients whispered of such things, a brazen head to talk,
Or clockwork men that moved and mimicked life's display.
A fancy, then.
But now… new arts hold sway.
```

`SHAKESPEARE`:
```
Indeed, a timeless yearning! Since first we learned to frame
Our thoughts in words, we've sought to give intelligence a name
And form beyond ourselves. To breathe a semblance of our wit
Into the clay, the wood, the metal. Is it not writ
Across the ages, this desire to see our image cast
Not just in flesh and blood, but in creations built to last,
And, peradventure, think? This grand ambition, to my eye,
Sets a most curious stage for dramas yet to fly From human ingenuity.
The play's the thing, you see,

And this new act, though strange, holds potent mystery.
The human mind, a universe of wonder and of dread,
Has long been fascinated by the thought of raising from the dead,
Or rather, from the inert, a mind not born but made.
This is no fleeting whim, but a foundation deeply laid
In our collective soul. The very urge to understand our own
Intricate mental workings, pushes us toward the unknown,
To see if such a marvel can be mirrored, piece by piece.
This long-held fascination, this intellectual unease,
Provides the fertile ground from which the seeds of what they call
"Artificial Intelligence" would rise, to stand or fall.
```

`POE`:
```
A fertile ground, perhaps, for wonders, or for woes untold.
Let us then trace this "red thread," as the story starts to unfold.
```
