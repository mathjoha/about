abstract: |
    Derrived from Journal Digital Corpus in order to perform a
    geographical analysis of Swedish newsreels from the
    Journal Digital corpus (1930-1965) using Named Entity Recognition (NER),
    geolocation validation, and geocoding. The pipeline extracts location mentions
    from video subtitles, validates them against the GeoNames gazetteer, and
    converts them to geographic coordinates using Nominatim. Results include
    validated location datasets, temporal analysis of geographic mentions, regional
    distribution statistics, and JSON exports for spatial visualization. The
    project provides tools for preprocessing NER data, analyzing location patterns
    over time, and generating interactive visualizations of geographic coverage in
    Swedish newsreel production.
