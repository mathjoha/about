abstract: |
    SWINNO is a database of Swedish innovations constructed with the [LBIO method](https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/7f414c8c-846a-4b98-8aea-02c657a1961a) by a research project by the [same name](https://www.lusem.lu.se/organisation/department-economic-history/research-department-economic-history/databases-department-economic-history/swedish-innovations-swinno). The dataset has been gathered and constructed since 2010 by a several researchers and assistants (I have been one of them), and had been published several times in an .xlsx format.

    In this series of releases I tried to create a user-friendly dataset that retains as much of the relational-structure of the FileMaker database in a user friendlier format (SQLite3). The release is a scaled down version that does away with all the the _sensitive_ data and controls necessary for constructing the data but not necessary for using it . In more recent versions this repository also contain he original format (.xlsx) -- included since in the latest release -- and publishes a scaled down version of the original FileMaker database as a SQLite3 database and each table is in a separate .csv file. Metadata is published separately as a [living-codebook](https://swinnoproject.github.io/living_codebook/).
