    A dataset of geolocated travel guide toponyms, compiled in the process of a research project Historical GIS and Guidebooks: A Scalable Reading of Czechoslovak Tourist Attractions (Bechmann Pedersen & Johansson, forthcoming) in which we performed a scalable reading of three travel guides of the former Czechoslovak lands as they were cirka 1959. We used a specialized, open-sourced tool CITADEL created for this project, which in itself relies on open-sourced data from GeoNames and WikiData.
