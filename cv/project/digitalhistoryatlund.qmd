    DigitalHistory@Lund is an interdepartmental research platform dedicated to
    advancing digital history research at Lund University. It works to
    integrate existing digital history projects and supports the design and
    execution of new projects. At the same time, the platform strives to build
    local digital history capacity through skills training workshops, research
    seminars, research engineer support, and by developing new courses in digital history.

    We help researchers develop new cutting-edge historical projects, e.g. by
    supporting the collection, cleaning, and analysis of data, and by preparing
    grant applications.

    DigitalHistory@Lund is an initiative by the Section for Media History in
    close collaboration with Lund Centre for the History of Knowledge (LUCK)
    and Lund University Humanities Lab. The platform works with Lund University
    Libraries and other GLAM-partners in Sweden. It was funded by the Joint
    Faculties of Humanities and Theology.

    Since 2023 we have been arranging regular meetings for people to drop in
    with their Digital History/Humanities projects and problems to get help
    or just to focus working on them.
