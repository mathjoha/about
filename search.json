This tool is able to perform a battery of queries to create aggregated and disaggregated timelines. The second is a much simpler form, which is a SPA (Single Page Application) hosted as a static site on GitHub.

The material is retrieved from the SWERIK project and has been pre processed in preparation for this reader, namely:\n\nThe corpus has been segmented into individual utterances.\nSpeaker party and gender are in the utterance-level metadata.\nUtterances have been tagged with categories relevant for the research project.\nThe corpus has been split into one file per year, from 1900-1940 (the period under study).\n\nThe files are hosted next to the code that prepared them – and each year’s file is loaded into the reader as the user reaches that year. In this way the data becomes searchable, readable and browsable – accessible – to people without having to wrangle with .xml files.

    "text": "A few weeks ago I started playing around with Google’s AI-Studio and Gemini.app trying to test the limits of their public AI-systems can do. Among the experiments were a series of disappoinging attempts to make it produce code and a lot of amusement generating images and videos. I also gave it’s ‘research’ mode a spin which, unlike the code-generation and image-generation, requires very little effort in the way of prompt-engineering to produce decent results. You tell it to ‘research’ a topic (or topics), it presentes a plan of investigation (which you can influence further) and 20-30 minutes later you have your own wikipedia-like report (with less reliability). What impressed me the most was how neatly it can be used on my phone, once it starts ‘researching’ I can close down the app and get a notification when the report is ready (Not so for the other modes). This means that I can play around with it before I walk somewhere and by the time I am there, I have something to new to read!\nHowever, if I close down the app I do not get to see the number of ‘researched’ sources tick upwards. Which is part of my fascination with the process; it gives me a metric to target as I play around with it. Not only can you see how many sources (sites) it searches, a selection of these sources are also included as references in the report. To me, this is like having my own personalized pesudo-Wikipedia-article generator. Only, less reliable, worse prose, without images diagrams and links to other articles. But, it is a lot more flexible and a lot more convenient. It can be used similarly to how I tend to use Wikipedia: Get a basic understanding for some topic and gather further resources to read further.\nBesides the high dubiousness-level (technical term) of the fact checking, the prose tends to be very boring and bland. It has a tendency to over-summarise and sometimes over-explain simple information (based on my limited experiments). So, I decided to attempt to make the prose more entertaining. Specifically, to mimic the style of Douglas Hofstadter’s fugues in Gödel, Escher, Bach.\nHofstadter’s fugues manage to be downright entertaining despite dealing with abstract and complex ideas. So, I instructed Gemini to mimic this style while explaining the ascent of AI. A secondary motive for picking this topic was to produce a text or a case that I could use in teaching. At worst the output would be nonsense and therefore an interesting case to discuss, OR it would create a decent instructive overview. Either way, it had the potential to be both entertaining and useful. Having picked the topic, picking the two main discussants remained. Being lazy, I went with to of my default personas for an LLM to impersonate: Edgar Allan Pie and William Shakespeare – specifying that more temporary characters can be introduced as needed.\nThe result was an 8,00 word report based on 167 ‘researches’ websites out of which 124 were cited in the report! Two personal records right there! In total the report includes 7 fugues, and a prelude (included below). I must admit that I have to date only read the preamble and the overviews (of which there are two in the report!), but so far I am satisfied and entertained. Quite frankly, the most disappointing part of the report is that it ends with the release of Chat-GPT; sure it was an important event, but a lot of interesting things have happened since then!"

    "text": "Prelude: A Midnight Dreary, A Question Airy\nSCENE:\nA dimly lit study, overflowing with books and arcane instruments.\nEDGAR ALLAN POE sits hunched over a desk, quill in hand,\nthe flickering candlelight casting long, dancing shadows.\n\nThe hour is late.\nPOE:\n(Muttering to himself)\nOnce upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nNot of demons, nor of ravens tapping at my chamber door,\nBut of intellect—that spectral architect of thought,\nIts ghostly gears and levers, how a notion might be wrought\nFrom the ether of the mind, a phantasm given form.\nThis engine in the skull, that conjures calm and storm,\nIs it a sacred fire, a uniquely human spark?\nOr can its essence be distilled, to animate the dark\nAnd silent artifice of man, a mimicry of soul?\nTo cede to brass and wire, our intellectual control?\n(WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE enters, a knowing glimmer in his eye.\nHe carries a folio, perhaps of his own works.)\nSHAKESPEARE:\nGood Master Poe, still wrestling with the shades of night?\nYour brow is furrowed deep, as if by some internal fight.\nWhat phantoms vex thee now? Is it the muse, that fickle sprite,\nOr some new terror of the soul, that shuns the morning's light?\nPOE:\nAh, good Will. 'Tis not the muse, but a query yet more dire.\nThis \"stuff that dreams are made on,\" as your Prospero did conspire\nTo name our fleeting thoughts – this power to reason and to feel,\nIs it a gift divine, or something we might steal,\nOr rather, replicate, in constructs of our own design?\nCould mind itself be patterned, line by intricate line,\nLike verse, or like the workings of some complex, ticking clock?\nThe ancients whispered of such things, a brazen head to talk,\nOr clockwork men that moved and mimicked life's display.\nA fancy, then.\nBut now… new arts hold sway.\nSHAKESPEARE:\nIndeed, a timeless yearning! Since first we learned to frame\nOur thoughts in words, we've sought to give intelligence a name\nAnd form beyond ourselves. To breathe a semblance of our wit\nInto the clay, the wood, the metal. Is it not writ\nAcross the ages, this desire to see our image cast\nNot just in flesh and blood, but in creations built to last,\nAnd, peradventure, think? This grand ambition, to my eye,\nSets a most curious stage for dramas yet to fly From human ingenuity.\nThe play's the thing, you see,\n\nAnd this new act, though strange, holds potent mystery.\nThe human mind, a universe of wonder and of dread,\nHas long been fascinated by the thought of raising from the dead,\nOr rather, from the inert, a mind not born but made.\nThis is no fleeting whim, but a foundation deeply laid\nIn our collective soul. The very urge to understand our own\nIntricate mental workings, pushes us toward the unknown,\nTo see if such a marvel can be mirrored, piece by piece.\nThis long-held fascination, this intellectual unease,\nProvides the fertile ground from which the seeds of what they call\n\"Artificial Intelligence\" would rise, to stand or fall.\nPOE:\nA fertile ground, perhaps, for wonders, or for woes untold.\nLet us then trace this \"red thread,\" as the story starts to unfold."

The dataset has been gathered and constructed since 2010 by a several researchers and assistants (I have been one of them), and had been published several times in an .xlsx format.\nIn this series of releases I tried to create a user-friendly dataset that retains as much of the relational-structure of the FileMaker database in a user friendlier format (SQLite3). The release is a scaled down version that does away with all the the sensitive data and controls necessary for constructing the data but not necessary for using it . In more recent versions this repository also contain he original format (.xlsx) – included since in the latest release – and publishes a scaled down version of the original FileMaker database as a SQLite3 database and each table is in a separate .csv file. Metadata is published separately as a living-codebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 31, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Journal Digital Corpus\n\n\n\n\n\nA corpus of the speech and intertitles of the Swedish Newsreel archive Journal Digital.

The pipeline extracts location mentions from video subtitles, validates them against the GeoNames gazetteer, and converts them to geographic coordinates using Nominatim. Results include validated location datasets, temporal analysis of geographic mentions, regional distribution statistics, and JSON exports for spatial visualization. The project provides tools for preprocessing NER data, analyzing location patterns over time, and generating interactive visualizations of geographic coverage in Swedish newsreel production.\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 2, 2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Historical GIS and Guidebooks:\n\n\nCzechoslovak Tourist Attractions\n\n\nA dataset of geolocated travel guide toponyms, compiled in the process of a research project Historical GIS and Guidebooks: A Scalable Reading of Czechoslovak Tourist Attractions (Bechmann Pedersen & Johansson, forthcoming) in which we performed a scalable reading of three travel guides of the former Czechoslovak lands as they were cirka 1959. We used a specialized, open-sourced tool CITADEL created for this project, which in itself relies on open-sourced data from GeoNames and WikiData.\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Supplementary material to ‘Automatic Identification of Hate Speech – A Case-Study of Alt-Right YouTube Videos’\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplementary material for the article Supplementary material to ‘Automatic Identification of Hate Speech – A Case-Study of Alt-Right YouTube Videos’. The dataset is restricted due to the sensitive nature of its contents: Transcriptions gathered from YouTube which we have processed with a classifier trained to detect hate speech.\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 8, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
