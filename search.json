The dataset has been gathered and constructed since 2010 by a several researchers and assistants (I have been one of them), and had been published several times in an .xlsx format.\nIn this series of releases I tried to create a user-friendly dataset that retains as much of the relational-structure of the FileMaker database in a user friendlier format (SQLite3). The release is a scaled down version that does away with all the the sensitive data and controls necessary for constructing the data but not necessary for using it . In more recent versions this repository also contain he original format (.xlsx) – included since in the latest release – and publishes a scaled down version of the original FileMaker database as a SQLite3 database and each table is in a separate .csv file. Metadata is published separately as a living-codebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 31, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n UK Hansard 1935-2014\n\n\nA metadata enriched version of the Hansard corpus\n\n\nOne of the outputs from Betto van Waarden’s Marie Skłodowska-Curie project “Presenting Parliament: Parliamentarians’ visions of the communication and role of parliament within the mediated democracies of Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands, 1844-1995.”\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Historical GIS and Guidebooks:\n\n\nCzechoslovak Tourist Attractions\n\n\nA dataset of geolocated travel guide toponyms, compiled in the process of a research project Historical GIS and Guidebooks: A Scalable Reading of Czechoslovak Tourist Attractions (Bechmann Pedersen & Johansson, forthcoming) in which we performed a scalable reading of three travel guides of the former Czechoslovak lands as they were cirka 1959.
